;; 02.01
;; Write a function MAKE-EVEN that makes an odd number even by adding one to it.
;; If the input to MAKE-EVEN is already even, it should be returned unchanged.
(defun make-even (n)

;; 02.02
;; Write a function FURTHER that makes a positive number larger by adding one to it,
;; and a negative number smaller by subtracting one from it. What does your function do if given the number 0?

;; 02.03
;; Recall the primitive function NOT: It returns NIL for a true input and T for a false one.
;; Suppose Lisp didnâ€™t have a NOT primitive. Show how to write NOT using just IF and constants (no other functions).
(defun my-not (input)
  (if input
      't

;; 02.04
;; Write a function ORDERED that takes two numbers as input and makes a list of them in ascending order.
;; (ORDERED 3 4) should return the list (3 4). (ORDERED 4 3) should also return (3 4), in other words,
;; the first and second inputs should appear in reverse order when the first is greater than the second.
(defun ordered (n1 n2)

        ((= n 0) n)
        (t (- n))))

;; TODO 02.06
;; Write EMPHASIZE3, which is like EMPHASIZE2 but adds the symbol VERY onto the list if it doesn't know how to emphasize it.
;; For example, EMPHASIZE3 of (LONG DAY) should produce (VERY LONG DAY). What does EMPHASIZE3 of (VERY LONG DAY) produce?

;; TODO 02.07
;; Write a function CONSTRAIN that takes three inputs called X, MAX, and MIN. If X is less than MIN, it should return MIN;
;; if X is greater than MAX, it should return MAX. Otherwise, since X is between MIN and MAX, it should return X.
;; (CONSTRAIN 3 -50 50) should return 3. (CONSTRAIN 92 -50 50) should return 50. Write one version using COND and another
;; using nested IFs.
